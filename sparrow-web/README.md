# sparrow-web

A front-end side of sparrow

### Setting up

Run `npm install` from the root directory

### Running it

Run `gulp dev` (may require installing Gulp globally `npm install gulp -g`)


### General Project Structure

Most of the UI work will be in two main folders inside `app/js`

1. `components` : Most of the React components will be in here
2. `pages`: Every page that corresponds to the URL will be in here

Apart from that, there are the folders related to the framework called RefluxJS. The learning curve here is a little higher than ReactJS, but feel free to try. We will need at least one person (besides Gott) working on this part.

### Team and responsibility

* Gott - Design, React, Reflux, CSS
* Yao
* Owen
* Nathan
