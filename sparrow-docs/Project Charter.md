A Project Charter for a location-based lending app called Sparrow.

## Problem Statement
Often, there might be a time when people need an item urgently and temporarily, which makes buying the item less preferable than borrowing the item. That's why offering an urgent lending service would tackle this problem quite efficiently. 

## Project Objective
 - Allow borrowers to request the item they want to borrow and how urgently they want it
 - Display the list of borrowing requests in real-time, and notify the lenders who subscribed to that category
 - Allow communication between prospective lenders and borrowers before actually meeting in person
 - Offer an option to place money as an incentive to draw more lenders in
 - Offer an option for lenders to request a deposit when the item is of high value
 - Include a "point" system to encourage more lending and track lender / borrower reputation
 - Allow users to limit lending certain items to people selected as "Friends" or other categories

## Stakeholders
- Users: Anyone who wants to lend and borrow items locally
- Developers: Yao Xiao, Joseph Bruckner, Nathan Chang, Zilun Mai, Saranyu Phusit, Sargun Vohra
- Project Coordinator: Sayali Salvi
- Project Owners: Yao Xiao, Joseph Bruckner, Nathan Chang, Zilun Mai, Saranyu Phusit, Sargun Vohra

## Deliverables
 - Front-end: A browser based web application for both lenders and borrowers to post and communicate with each other
 - Back-end: A web service with a REST API to handle communication between the front-end and the database
 - A database which contains all lending history, requests, and users
